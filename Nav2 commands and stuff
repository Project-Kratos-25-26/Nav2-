/map - costmap subscribes to this 
(is the occupancy grid being dynamically or statically published?)
(does the map publisher also offer /map_updates?)
/odom - carrying nav_msgs/Odometry that the controller server uses.

SLAM Toolbox = localization + map
Nav2 = planning




AMCL: Localization on a prebuilt map (needs laser/scan).  AMCL NOT NEEDED

RTAB-Map: Full SLAM (mapping + localization). Already publishes map → odom, so no AMCL needed.

For Nav2:

With AMCL: /map from map_server + map → odom from AMCL.

With RTAB-Map: /map and map → odom from RTAB-Map itself.




LAUNCH SLAM TOOLBOX AS WELL
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py params_file:=/opt/ros/humble/share/slam_toolbox/config/mapper_params_online_async.yaml use_sim_time:=true
 

cd /opt/ros/humble/share/slam_toolbox/config/   (location for slam toolbox stuff)



NAV2
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py   params_file:=/opt/ros/humble/share/nav2_bringup/params/nav2_params.yaml   use_sim_time:=true   slam:=True
(transforms for nav2)

ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 map odom
(giving manual goal)
